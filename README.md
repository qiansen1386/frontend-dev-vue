Frontend Dev Vue
==============

This is designed as a starting Point for front-end development.
However, in fact it is more like a experimental project to test out the latest concepts of Frontend Engineering, like Components, Modules, build Pipelines, Single-Page-Application, MVVM, and so on.

In this project I wanna gain more understanding about those state of the art technologies, with almost no realistic considerations at all. For example, I may use stage-0 features.

## Build Steps

`npm install`

`npm dev`

Go to `localhost:8080`
